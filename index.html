            <p>I am Pennsylvania native raised out in the sticks of Montana. I grew up in the beautiful Flathead Valley on a farm. I spent a lot of time helping raise our cattle and tending to the farm as needed. I learned a lot about working hard and really taking pride in the work that I do. When I wasn't farming, I enjoyed coaching and playing hockey in my spare time and do so regularly as my way to unwind. I moved to Richmond about 5 years ago for a job and to get out of Montana. It was a pretty big change for me but also exciting.
            </p>

            <p>When I moved to Richmond it was to become a NDT Technician for Applied Technical Services. I worked in a variety of high stress enviorments ranging from Nuclear Plants all the way to pipelines and everything in between. I also gained experience doing international work for the navy in Japan on their destroyers. I was qualified in a number of different methods of inspection, the most important being Phased Array Ultrasonics (PAUT). I was one of a very exclusive group and one of the youngest in my company to obtain the certification. Along with PAUT I also was qualified for Radiography, Magnetic Particle Testing, Coneventional Ultrasonics, and Liquid Penetrant testing. I was in charge of a number of different projects of varying size and difficulty. Typically I was responsible for customer satisfaction/interaction, managing team members, and responsibly carrying out my own inspections.</p> 
                
            <p>Prior to working for Applied Technical Services I worked as a Seasonal Firefighter fighting wild land fires doing structure defense and suppression. When it was the off season I helped out around the farm and worked as a Mobile Specialist at Best Buy in Kalispell, MT. Each job brought its own challenges from working in extremely hazardous situations to dealing with people who were having a bad day and wanted to use me as a punching bag. All of these varying experiences have made me into a very well rounded individual able to help and lead people through many different types of challenges faced in the work place. I gained experience interacting with customers and helping discern their needs and applying the best possible solution. I developed my ability to lead large varying teams of people efficiently towards a common goal on schedule and by the given deadlines. All of this has helped make me into a driven individual that continually pushes to find new challenging opportunites to grow and learn.</p>

            <p>The most common question I get asked lately is "If I really was so successful with my previous employer why would I switch careers?" The answer is really simple, I hated not having any sort of life. I was continually on the road working all hours of the day and night, often 84 plus hours a week. It was physically demanding and harmful, and I did not want to continue sacrificing my personal life to make a paycheck. I spent a long time debating my options and talking to many different people about what I wanted to do whether it was stay the course or switch it up. Ultimately I decided I was still young and I settled on the Tech Indusrty as I have a family full of Software Consultants, Developers, and Project Managers. I have always been technically inclined though I had never really tried coding and began dabbling in it with my free time. I found that I enjoyed the problem solving aspect of it and ended up at the University of Richmond taking a bootcamp to help kickstart my new chosen career path. By the end of this year I hope to be a competent entry level developer with the intent of learning Software Development as well as expanding my knowledge in Web Development. I look forward to the opportunities and challenges ahead.</p>
